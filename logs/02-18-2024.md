## Team Meeting Notes
### WHEN: 02/18/2024 @2PM
### WHO: (everyone) Yara, Olivia, Sam, Mariam, Aniketh, Zach (joined late)
### WHERE: Discord Voice Chat

#### Notes:
This was our first team meeting. 

We made introductions and waited for Zach to join until 2:05. He didn't join in time so we started without him. He joined halfway through the meeting.

We looked over the assigned project and decided to move forward with the boolean calculator project idea posted by professor Saidien.

After that, we discussed roles and responsibilities for all team members and ended up with the following (outlined in more details in the Team-Roles document):

* team leader: yara
* assistant team leader: olivia
* product owner: mariam
* technical lead: aniketh
* design/testing engineer: sam
* software engineer: zach


We also discussed general guidelines for team member responsbilites (independant of the role), which are also outlined in the Team-Roles document.

Yara created a sharepoint directory for the team members to share, view, and collaborate on all of the project-related documents.

Aniketh created a GitHub repo and added the team members to it as colaborators.

The team leads (Olivia and Yara) agreed to setup a later time to complete the project plan document.
